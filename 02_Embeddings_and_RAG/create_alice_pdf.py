        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, 
        and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her 
        sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what 
        is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'
        """, body_style),
        
        Paragraph("""
        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot 
        day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making 
        a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the 
        daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
        """, body_style),
        
        Paragraph("""
        There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so 
        very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh 
        dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred 
        to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all 
        seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of 
        its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started 
        to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen 
        a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and 
        burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately 
        was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
        """, body_style),
        
        Paragraph("""
        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in 
        the world she was to get out again.

        Paragraph("""
        'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that 
        for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm 
        opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' 
        (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of 
        sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder 
        who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I 
        shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself 
        about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to 
        them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! 
        Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'

        And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must 
        go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending 
        presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

        They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the 
        birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close 
        to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

        Paragraph("""
        The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a 
        consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural 
        to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had 
        known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the 
        Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than you, 
        and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how 
        old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was 
        no more to be said.
